The is a game of concentration... No repeats... Or hesitations... Are you ready? Let's Go!

## Instructions

This is your classic game of Memory! Flip two cards in a turn, trying to find matching pairs. Your timer will begin after your first click. Once all eight pairs have been matched, the game ends. The fewer moves you make, the more stars you keep! Try to beat the clock! Or narrow down your moves and earn a three star game!
