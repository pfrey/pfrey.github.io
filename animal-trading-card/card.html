			<p>The four-toed hedgehog is one of the most popular species of domesticated hedgehogs. They are solitary and nocturnal animals. They generally stay on the ground foraging for insects, grubs, snails, spiders, and the like. But they are capable of swimming and climbing, if it becomes necessary.</p>
