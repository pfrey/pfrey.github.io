## Instructions

This is a classic game of Frogger! There are Players and there are Enemies (ie Bugs). The object of this game is for the player to move from the grass (bottom) to the water (top) without running into any enemies. 

You can move your character up, down, left, and right. The enemies are contained to the paved sidewalk portion of the screen but also move at various rates.

If your character collides with an enemy, the game will reset and your character will be moved back to the starting position. Once your character reaches the water, the game is won!
